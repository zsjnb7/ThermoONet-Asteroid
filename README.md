# ThermoONet_Asteroid: A Deep Learning Framework for Asteroid Thermophysical Modeling and Yarkovsky Effect
ThermoONet_Asteroid is a PyTorch-based deep learning framework designed for asteroid thermophysical modeling and yarkovsky Effect. It uses a modified deep operator neural network architecture with channel attention mechanisms to model the thermal behavior of asteroid and estimate yarkovsky effect.
